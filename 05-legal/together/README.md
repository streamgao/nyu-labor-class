# Together

This is an app that ties together all of the topics we've covered. It's a full featured marketplace for labor. 

I wanted to address 3 things, the product needs to be...
  * fun and useful for the end user (both askers and answerers)
  * a way for the users to earn money
  * a net positive for the world

Specifically, it's a question and answer service: 

  * You can ask questions and answer them
  * You pay $1 to ask a question and the money is split among the people who worked on your question
    * 50% goes to the top answerer
    * 30% goes to the researchers
    * 20% goes to the house
  *  If your question isn't answered, you have the option to send it to a 3rd party service (fancy hands).
