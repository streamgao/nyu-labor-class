## Assignment

* Email me an informal project proposal by **Feb 24th at Noon**
  * What are you going to build? 
  * What are the different parts? 
    * Example using your own labor pool
      * The `client` submits a form with collecting information needed
      * The information is displayed as a list for the `worker` to choose from
      * The `worker` selects a `job`, has some way to complete it
      * Your code takes the results, combines them, and displays the `product`
    * Example using a 3rd party labor pool
      * The `client` submits a form with XYZ info
      * That info gets sent to a Fancy Hands `worker` to do the `job`
      * Your code takes the results, combines them, and displays the `product`
	  
* Prepare a final project proposal
  * Next week, you'll talk about what we can expect to see in
