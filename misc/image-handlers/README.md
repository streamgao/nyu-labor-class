# Image Examples

This is based of the code from `workers` 

```shell
npm install 
```

**Before** you can run this, you'll need to set the following things in the file:

 - `FANCY_HANDS_API_KEY` => the API key for Fancy Hands
 - `FANCY_HANDS_API_SECRET` => the API secret for Fancy Hands 
 - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` => the API key for Cloudinary
 - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` => the API secret for Cloudinary
 - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` => the Cloud name for Cloudinary 


And then run

```shell
node app.js
```


Once it's running, you should be able to view the running example at `localhost:3000`
