### Introducing the *Final* Project

Everyone will build an app (or website) that demonstrates some of the different aspects of the future or labor. Specifically, I want you to build an app that would only be possible using a human labor component. Your final app needs to be a mix of humans and code.

#### What will you hand in?

* A blog post detailing your app
  * Talk about the inspiration for your app, what it does, who will use it, why, etc.
  * Discuss the different parts (`clients`, `workers`, `jobs`, `products`)
  * 
* A zip file of the code
* You will present your application in class (10 minutes each)
  * You should be able to demo your application
    * If it doesn't demo well, have one ready to go that you can show us (like on a baking show)

#### What does your app need to have?

* It has to have `workers` -- people who perform the work, examples:
  * On uber, the `worker` is the driver
  * On AirBNB, the `worker` is the host
  * Who will be the worker for you app?
    * Your custom work force (yourself, other students, etc)
	* Fancy Hands
	* Mechanical Turk
* It has to have at least one `client` -- who is the user of the application/service?
  * On uber the `client` is the person riding in the car (not the driver)
  * On AirBNB the `client` is the person paying to stay in the room/house/apartment
* It needs to have a `job` -- a discrete unit of work:
  * On uber a `job` is the car trip
  * On AirBNB, the `job` would be guests staying at host's apartment
  * On task rabbit, the `job` would be installing a TV.
  * On Crowdflower, the `job` might be transcribing 1 minute of a 10 minute audio file
  * On Mechanical Turk, a `job` might be looking up email addresses for a company or [more examples...](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/findhits?match=false)
* It needs to have an end `product`:
  * The `job` itself may be the end `product`
    * The car trip on uber is the `product`
    * The time spent staying in the host's house/apartment is the `product`
  * The result of `job` may be the `product`
    * On task rabbit, the `product` would be a fully installed TV
  * The `product` may be the result of several `jobs` by one or more `workers`
    * Audio transcription could be broken into several `jobs` and reassmbled into a final `product`

#### Things to think about

* Who are the `clients`?
  * Who would use your app? Why? What problem does it solve? 
* Who are the `workers` doing the work?
  * Would you use a 3rd party service or build up a pool of "workers."
  * Would they get paid or could you *gamify* them into doing it ?
* What would the `job` be?
  * How would you present the `job`?
  * How would the `job` get completed?
  * How would it be verified?
    * Could it be programmatically verified?
* What would the end result (or `product`) be?
  * Would the `product` be the end result of each `job` (for example: the `worker` does audio transcription and the `product` is the text document)
  * Would the `product` be the sum of several results? ("Does this image contain nudity?")
